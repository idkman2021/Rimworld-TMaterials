	<description>40+ new materials with a sole purpose to spice up procedural generation of stuffed weapons, apparel and structures. For example, you will now see bronze and iron weapons being used by NPCs. By default doesn't clutter the game with mineable resources and crafting recipes, but you can change that in mod settings and toggle each material individually.
        
    Vanilla Expanded Framework is highly recommended for correct spawning chances.</description>
