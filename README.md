100+ new materials using vanilla style 128x128 texures, with a sole purpose to spice up procedural generation of stuffed weapons, apparel and structures. For example, you will now see bronze and iron weapons being used by NPCs. By default doesn't clutter the game with mineable resources and crafting recipes. 

I plan to make it so that you will be able to enable crafting recipies and mining in mod settings.
        
Vanilla Expanded Framework is highly recommended for correct spawning chances.
